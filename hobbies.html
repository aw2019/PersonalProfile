      <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
      <p>For fun, I often like to be at leisure with my family, and our Miniature Poodle, in our home. Or, I like to hang out in the town with fam or friends. Occasionally, my family and I go to the movies on the weekend, or during the week I participate in school extra curriculars with my friends and classmates, or I pursue my own individual interests or entrepreneurial ventures. Below you'll see a list of select hobbies of mine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Being Creative</li>
